Title: Web Development Project for Collecting User Information
            An simple Web Application through which user can enter their input details of themselves and view them after submission which is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Overview:
            This project of mine involves two web pages "Registertation Page" and "Display Page". The Registeration Page mainly involved in collecting the user infromation such as User name, their email id, department,
      their project , description about their project and image of the user.

Features:
  1   Registeration Page:
                      Consist of 6 input tags in the form field to get the User Name, Email ID, Department, Project link, Description and Image of the user.Each has some constraints of its own , like only uppercase
      elements are allowed for the user name, email is supposed to end with "@gmail.com" tag and the image file size should not go over 2Mb. Submission of the data without any incomplete doesnt proceed with next 
      step of displaying the user information.
    
  2  Display Page:
            In the display page when all the data fields are filled and submitted the data is diplayed in the display page which is a seperate file and the data collected in the registeration page is used 
      in this page by temporarily storing it in the local storage .
